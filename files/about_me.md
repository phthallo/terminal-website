<h4>heya, i'm phthallo</h4>
<p>i'm a 17 year old from australia. i'm currently taking a gap year to volunteer with <a target="_blank" href = "https://hackclub.com">hack club</a> - a home for teenage hackers and programmers all around the world. </p>
<p>you can probably find me trying new things, building completely useless projects and going on sidequests.</p>

<p>outside of programming, i enjoy:</p>

<ul>
    <li>indie games; i'm a huge fan of celeste and hollow knight
    <li>sci-fi and fantasy media
    <li>comedy tv shows! hit me up to talk about taskmaster!
    <li>art of all kinds 
    <li><a target="_blank" href = "https://open.spotify.com/user/by9ol1keui3n1yfhqpxskyjn3">music</a>; primarily indie and alternative bands
</ul>
