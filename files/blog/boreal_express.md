  ...the greatest cross-vancouver hackathon there will ever be.
</pre>
<p>
<a href = "https://boreal.hackclub.com">the boreal express</a> was my first ever hackathon, and honestly, it's tough to beat. 
<p>
when zoya first reached out to me on the hack club slack, i legitimately thought she had automated her account to send messages to everyone, because there was no way that i'd actually gotten an invite, right? i knew it existed - i'd looked at the EOI form a few weeks before and seeing the week that it was happening coincided with <a href = "https://www.education.sa.gov.au/students/term-dates-south-australian-state-schools">the start of the school semester</a> i didn't think i'd be able to go (spoiler: i did, now i'm paying the price (catching up on all of my assignments))
<p>
21 hours of travel, two layovers in sydney and fiji, and one delayed luggage later*, i was in vancouver. something i distinctly remember commenting on was how green the airport was^ to robert and sam (the best fluro-vested airport guides anyone could ask for). truly one of the sleep deprivation moments of all time.
<p>
at jericho beach, which is genuinely gorgeous, i met zoya irl for the first time (and got to hear everyone's very strange american accents)! i won't lie that i felt somewhat out of place here. i was in a whole different country under an <a href = "https://www.forbes.com/sites/jillianscudder/2017/09/09/astroquizzical-upside-down-moon/">upside-down moon</a> surrounded by a lot of people i didn't know. 
<p>
before the boreal express, i kept to myself. i joined hack club in june 2024 because of arcade, and not gonna lie, the "arcade" side of hack club is so completely different from everywhere else. i'd talk to people if they commented on the projects i'd shipped in #scrapbook, or occasionally jump into conversations about commonalities, but other than that? /hack time. for that reason, yes, i did feel that i didn't necessarily belong because i was a newcomer to hack club (but hey, i wasn't the only one anyways!). oh, and classic imposter syndrome.
<p>
i found my people, though. sarah, nachu, andrea, savina, ruby. you all made my time on the boreal express brilliant. that's not to mention everyone else, working incredibly hard to get this train moving. from midnight karaoke (i want it that way >>>) to spontaneous tours of the prestige class cabins (including some <i>very</i> professional photoshoots), i had the time of my life here. 
<p>
on the final day, i went out with matthew in the city to see vancouver town hall (which is certainly majestic), and later also with brody and leonard at dinner ('fried rice'). of course, there was also a great lunch with robert, angad, and lucas earlier in the day, before we all parted ways. oh, and a very memorable "hey dev we all upgraded our seats to business class using hack club funds, hope that's okay" followed by a panicked phone call.
<p>
on the final, final day, i explored vancouver, visiting the art gallery (where i saw a couple <i>getting married</i> on its steps), and exploring the downtown area near vancouver convention centre. during that time, i thought: <i>this is the first time i've spent a whole day, entirely by myself.</i> no family, no friends, no guardians, just me and this huge, sprawling city. there was a woman working at the art gallery gift shop who looked at my shirt and exclaimed "ah, computer science!" and i thought: maybe she has a family member who studied computer science, maybe she did. and isn't it  funny, that i would bring my national computer science summer school† shirt to another continent and someone would look at it and acknowledge it for what it was? that just a few days prior - for this ephemeral, fleeting moment, a break from the reality of year 12 and impending uni apps and my part-time job - i had met dozens of teenagers all over the world who had done the same?
<p> 
and you know what? it was worth it. i was out and about on the other side of the world with two assessments to catch up on and two submitted early, and it was still worth it. the train didn't make it to toronto, and it was still worth it. my checked luggage is stil somewhere in canada - shipped to toronto before the train turned around back to vancouver - and despite missing nearly all of my clothes (shout out to christina for taking me to buy more and to dev for handling the entire situation!) it was still worth it. 
<p>
this experience is one that i'll treasure forever. and for you reading this, i hope that you have something that means this much to you.
