Frontend for my personal Linux terminal-style website! (complete with Hyfetch)

Featuring: 
- Semi-accurate representation of a Linux terminal!
- A blog post system! `cd blog` to see what I've written.
- `ls`, `cat`, `clear`, and maybe a few other commands :) 
- Fun and completely useless facts!
- Accurate timestamps and uptime! (relative to the viewer)
- Easter eggs! (I may have lost count)
