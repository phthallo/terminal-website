Frontend for my personal Linux terminal-style website! (complete with Hyfetch)

### Features
- Semi-accurate representation of a Linux terminal!
- A blog post system! `cd blog` to see what I've written.
- `ls`, `cat`, `cd`, `clear`, and maybe a few other commands :) 
- Supports command history (aw yeah) 
- Responsive, semi-mobile friendly design
- Fun and completely useless facts!
- Accurate timestamps and uptime! (relative to the viewer)
- Easter eggs! (i added so many that i lost count)

### The Design Processâ„¢

This project is 100% vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript. Why? I have no idea either. In the future I'd love to rewrite this using an actual framework.
It's hosted on [Nest](https://guides.hackclub.app/index.php/Main_Page) as a static site.

### hyfetch?

It's [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch), with [pride flags](https://github.com/hykilpikonna/hyfetch).
